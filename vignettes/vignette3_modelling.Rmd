## Stage 3: Explanatory variable data 
In this tutorial, we will be fitting boosted regression tree
SDMs to our dataset, whilst accounting for spatial and temporal autocorrelation.

## Import covariates 

The covariate data frame generated in the second tutorial can be imported from your project
directory.

```{r create directories}
project_directory <- file.path(file.path(tempdir(), "dynamicSDM_vignette"))
# project_directory<-"your_path_here"
dir.create(project_directory)

#sample_explan_data <- read.csv(paste0(project_directory, "/extracted_quelea_occ.csv"))
```

Or alternatively, you can run the code below to read the pre-extracted data into your R environment
from the *dynamicSDM* package.

```{r import explanatory data}
data("sample_explan_data")
```


### a)	Test for spatial and temporal autocorrelation

Autocorrelation is when explanatory variable data for species records taken closer in space and time
are more similar to each other than to those of records more distantly sampled. When species
distribution modelling with spatiotemporally dynamic explanatory variables, spatial and temporal
autocorrelation can impact model performance.

Run the code below to test for spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the extracted explanatory
variable data using `spatiotemp_autocorr()`. This function can also generate a temporal
autocorrelation plot for each variable.

```{r example-spatiotemp_autocorr}
variablenames<-c("eight_sum_prec","year_sum_prec","grass_crop_percentage")

autocorrelation <- spatiotemp_autocorr(sample_explan_data,
                                       varname = variablenames,
                                       temporal.level = c("year")) # can choose month or day too


autocorrelation
```


### b)	Accounting for spatial and temporal autocorrelation

One approach to account for autocorrelation when species distribution modelling is to split records
into sampling units based upon spatial and temporal factors, and then group units into separate
blocks so that the mean and standard deviation of ecoclimatic variables are roughly equal across
blocks. SDMs are then fitted in a jack-knife approach, leaving out each block in-turn to use as the
test dataset.

`spatiotemp_block()` splits occurrence records into sampling units by spatial categories (e.g.
ecoregions or biome) and temporal units (e.g. month or year of record), before blocking the data. As
some spatial categories can be very large, the argument spatial.split.degrees can be used to split
large contiguous regions into smaller units.

In our case study, we use a raster of various biomes in southern Africa and split large biomes by 3
degree cells. The function has returned the original data frame with an additional column containing
the block numbers that each record belongs to.

```{r example-spatiotemp_block}
data("sample_biome_data")

sample_explan_data <- spatiotemp_block(sample_explan_data,
                                     spatial.layer = sample_biome_data,
                                     spatial.split.degrees = 3,
                                     vars.to.block.by = variablenames,
                                     temporal.block = "month",
                                     n.blocks = 3,
                                     iterations = 5000)
```

### c)	Fit species distribution models

There are many SDM approaches to modelling the relationships between species occurrence and
associated explanatory variables. *dynamicSDM* includes the function `brt_fit()` to fit boosted
regression tree models to training and test data. There are arguments to specify the blocks to split
data by (`block.col`, function returns a list of models the length of unique blocks) and to weight
records by spatiotemporal sampling effort (`weights.col`, see the Stage 1 tutorial).

```{r example-brt_fit}
sample_explan_data$weights <- (1 - sample_explan_data$REL_SAMP_EFFORT)

models <- brt_fit(sample_explan_data,
                  response.col = "presence.absence",
                  varnames = variablenames,
                  block.col = "BLOCK.CATS",
                  weights.col = "weights",
                  distribution = "bernoulli",
                  interaction.depth = 2)
```


##### Note: 
If you want to use other modelling approaches, this data frame of response and
explanatory variable data can easily be input into SDM functions in other packages.

## Summary
At the end of this vignette, we now have our fitted species distribution models for each
spatiotemporal block. Letâ€™s save this list of models to our project directory for use in the next
tutorial!

```{r save models, eval=F}
saveRDS(models, file = paste0(project_directory, "/fitted_quelea_SDMs.rds"))
```
