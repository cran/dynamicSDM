\arguments{
\item{dates}{a character string, vector of dates in format "YYYY-MM-DD".}

\item{projection.method}{a character string or vector, the method or methods to project
distribution and abundance onto projection covariates. Options include \code{proportional}, \code{binary},
\code{abundance} and \code{stacked}. See details for more information.}

\item{local.directory}{optional; a character string, the path to a local directory to read
projection covariate data frames from.}

\item{drive.folder}{optional; a character string, the Google Drive folder to read projection
covariate data frames from. Folder must be uniquely named within Google Drive. Do not provide
path.}

\item{user.email}{optional; a character string, user email for initialising Google Drive. Required
if \code{drive.folder} or \code{save.drive.folder} used.}

\item{sdm.mod}{optional; a model object or list of model objects fitted to species distribution
data.}

\item{sdm.thresh}{optional; a numeric value, the threshold to convert projected distribution
suitability into binary presence-absence. Default 0.5. Required if projection.method is
"\code{binary}" or  "\code{stacked}".}

\item{sdm.weight}{optional; a numeric string, weights given to each \code{sdm.mod} model projection,
given in the same order as the \code{sdm.mod} list. Default is equal weighting to all models.}

\item{sam.mod}{optional; a model object or list of model objects fitted to species abundance data.}

\item{sam.weight}{optional; a numeric string, weights given to each \code{sdm.mod} model projection,
given in the same order as the \code{sam.mod} list. Default is equal weighting to all models.}

\item{save.directory}{optional; a character string, path to local directory to save projection
rasters to.}

\item{save.drive.folder}{optional; a character string, Google Drive folder to save projection
rasters to. Folder must be uniquely named within Google Drive. Do not provide path.}

\item{cov.file.type}{a character string, the type of file that contains projection covariates. One
of: "\code{tif}" (raster stack) or \code{csv}(data frame).}

\item{prj}{a character string, the coordinate reference system of input projection covariates.
Default is "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84".}

\item{proj.prj}{a character string, the coordinate reference system desired for output projection
rasters. Default is assumed to be the same as prj.}

\item{spatial.mask}{an object of class \code{SpatRaster} or\code{sf} polygon, representing a mask in which
NA cells in the mask layer are removed from the projection covariates.}
}
\value{
Exports projection rasters for each projection date to user-specified Google Drive
folder or local directory.
}
\description{
Projects fitted species distribution and abundance models onto projection covariates for each date
given.
}
\details{
Function projects a model object or list of model objects onto projection covariate data
frames for each projection date given.
}
\section{Projection covariate input}{
\itemize{
\item Data frames: if \code{cov.file.type = csv}, then projection covariates must be saved "csv" files
in the \code{drive.folder} or \code{local.directory} given. Here, they must be unique in containing the
relevant projection date in YYYY-MM-DD format. For instance, two or more csv files saved
within the Google Drive folder or local directory that contain the projection date will result
in function error. Additionally, column names of projection covariate data frames must match the
explanatory variable names that fitted models are trained on.
\item Raster stacks: if \code{cov.file.type = tif}, then projection covariates must be saved "tif"
files, similarly named and formatted as above. Raster layer names must match the explanatory
variable names that fitted models are trained on.
}

Note: It is important to state the coordinate reference system projection of covariates using
argument \code{prj}.
}

\section{Model input}{
When multiple models are provided in \code{sdm.mod} or \code{sam.mod}, the function projects each model
onto the projection covariates and takes the average value across all model projections. If
\code{sdm.weight} or \code{sam.weight} is specified, then the weighted average of model projections is
returned. For example, this could be used to down weigh projections by poorly performing models
in an ensemble (Ara?jo and New, 2007).
}

\section{Projection output}{
\itemize{
\item proportional: Projects \code{sdm.mod} model objects onto projection covariates for each date,
exporting rasters for projected distribution suitability, a continuous measure between 0 (least
suitable) and 1 (most suitable).
\item binary: Projects \code{sdm.mod} onto projection covariates for each date, exporting rasters for
projected binary presence (1) or absence (0), derived from distribution suitability using
user-specified threshold (\code{sdm.thresh}) or default threshold of 0.5 (Jim?nez-Valverde And Lobo,
2007).
\item abundance: Projects \code{sam.mod} onto projections covariates for each date, exporting rasters for
projected abundance in the units that \code{sam.mod} were fitted onto.
\item stacked: Follows the binary projection method and then projects abundance onto only binary
presence (1) cells using the abundance projection method.
}

Projections are output as rasters. These can be reprojected to a different coordinate reference
system using argument \code{proj.prj}.

One or both of \code{save.drive.folder} and \code{save.directory} are required to specify where projection
rasters are to be saved.
}

\section{Google Drive compatibility}{
If \code{drive.folder} or \code{save.drive.folder} given, please ensure the folder name is unique within
your Google Drive. Do not provide the path if the folder is nested within others.

If one of \code{drive.folder} or \code{save.drive.folder} are used then \code{user.email} is required to access
the appropriate Google Drive user account. This requires users to have installed R package
\code{googledrive} and initialised Google Drive with valid log-in credentials. Please follow
instructions on \url{https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/}.
