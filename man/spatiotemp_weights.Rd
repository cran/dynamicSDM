\title{Calculate sampling effort across spatial and temporal buffer from species occurrence records}
\usage{
spatiotemp_weights(
  occ.data,
  samp.events,
  spatial.dist = 0,
  temporal.dist = 0,
  prj = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occ.data}{a data frame, with columns for occurrence record co-ordinates and dates with
column names as follows; record longitude as "x", latitude as "y", year as "year", month as
"month", and day as "day".}

\item{samp.events}{a data.frame, sampling events with column names as follows; record longitude as
"x", latitude as "y", year as "year", month as "month", and day as "day".}

\item{spatial.dist}{a numeric value, the spatial distance in metres representing the radius from
occurrence record co-ordinate to sum sampling events across.}

\item{temporal.dist}{a numeric value, the temporal distance in days, representing the period
before and after the occurrence record date to sum sampling events across.}

\item{prj}{a character string, the coordinate reference system of input \code{occ.data} co-ordinates
Default is "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84".}
}
\value{
Returns input occurrence record data frame with additional columns for sampling effort
"SAMP_EFFORT" and relative sampling effort "REL_SAMP_EFFORT".
}
\description{
Calculates the total number of sampling events across a given spatial and temporal buffer from
each occurrence recordâ€™s co-ordinate and date.
}
\details{
For each occurrence record, this function calculates the total number of sampling events
within given radius (\code{spatial.dist}) from each record co-ordinate and days (\code{temporal.dist})
both prior and post record date.

In addition to total sampling events, the function also calculates relative sampling effort,
scaling from 0 (least sampled) to 1 (most sampled).

Output could be used to calculate model weights to correct spatial and temporal biases in
occurrence record collections (Stolar and Nielsen, 2015).
